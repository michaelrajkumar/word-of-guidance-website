## Biblical Teachings on Christian Marriage

### Some Bible verses for singles to consider regarding marriage:

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

The LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him." (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2:18&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 2:18</a>)

God sets the lonely in families, he leads out the prisoners with singing; but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+68:6&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 68:6</a>)

He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+18:22&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 18:22</a>)

Do not be unequally bound together with unbelievers [do not make mismatched alliances with them, inconsistent with your faith]. For what partnership can righteousness have with lawlessness? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? 15 What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial (Satan)? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+6:14-15&version=AMP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 6:14-15 AMP</a>)

A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+31:10&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 31:10</a>)

### Biblical Perspective on Marriage:

Christian marriage is heavenly. The wife is the primary builder of the family as the care-giver of the family, following the teachings of the Bible. Care-giving takes more than 24 hours a day and more brains than Albert Einstein had, to build a healthy family! God is the wisdom-Giver and enabler of the wife, if only she can humbly seek wisdom from God, daily.

The couple should leave their parents and start their own family. (Parents, till they are widowed can live at a short distance away like the end of the same street but not in the house of their married children and should have no fixed or regular role in the family.) Temporary/encouraging visits either way is fine. When widowed, the aged father or mother can move to his/her son/daughter's home with a commitment to prayerful lifestyle and non-interference in son's or daughter's family.

The wife's unconditional obedience to her husband will automatically fetch his unconditional love. The husband's unconditional love for his wife naturally fetches her unconditional obedience.

Children should obey parents (until 18) by seeing mother's obedience to the father, as an example. (Children above 18 and still single can be open to the suggestions of parents, when it is godly).

Parents should not irritate children or control them as slaves or influence them with money or take advantage of their earnings or show partiality or quarrel in front of children. (A rare mild minute-long argument is forgivable). Life is short. It should not be foolishly wasted by quarrel/arguments. A Christian marriage is a union of two forgivers and not two arguers! (Forgiveness is the other active side of the coin of love). Allow enough time for reconciliation. Spouses should be instead mutual admirers and be grateful to each other for mutual support, each day. Spouses should encourage each other to be generous in hospitality and extend help to godly people who are in need (and the known needy people who approach them), as much as it is reasonable and financially feasible.

No place to be given between spouses for any third-party interference as a stumbling block or ungodly influencer or seducer or to develop inordinate or secretive affection. The love between the spouses should be only next to their love for God and exclusively superior to the love expressed toward to any other human being.

Even if ALL of the above go wrong, the members of the family should reconcile before sunset and fall on their knees and plead for God's help every sunset by FAMILY PRAYER. This family prayer is like oxygen for survival of the family! A prayerless family is bound to FAIL, in due course. Hearing that sunset family prayer, God will send His new grace as morning dew, all the days of their lives, so that the family can be a foretaste of heaven.
