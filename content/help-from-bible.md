### THE WAY OF SALVATION

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

Jesus said to him, I am the Way and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father except by (through) Me. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14:6&version=AMP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:6</a>)

And they answered, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ [give yourself up to Him, take yourself out of your own keeping and entrust yourself into His keeping] and you will be saved, [and this applies both to] you and your household as well. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16:31&version=AMP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 16:31</a>)

Because if you acknowledge and confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and in your heart believe (adhere to, trust in, and rely on the truth) that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10:9&version=AMP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 10:9</a>)

### COMFORT IN TIME OF LONELINESS

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

1 THE LORD is my Shepherd [to feed, guide, and shield me], I shall not lack. 2 He makes me lie down in [fresh, tender] green pastures; He leads me beside the still and restful waters. 3 He refreshes and restores my life (my self); He leads me in the paths of righteousness [uprightness and right standing with Him–not for my earning it, but] for His name's sake. 4 Yes, though I walk through the [deep, sunless] valley of the shadow of death, I will fear or dread no evil, for You are with me; Your rod [to protect] and Your staff [to guide], they comfort me. 5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my [brimming] cup runs over. 6 Surely or only goodness, mercy, and unfailing love shall follow me all the days of my life, and through the length of my days the house of the Lord [and His presence] shall be my dwelling place. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+23&version=AMP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 23</a>)

Fear not [there is nothing to fear], for I am with you; do not look around you in terror and be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen and harden you to difficulties, yes, I will help you; yes, I will hold you up and retain you with My [victorious] right hand of rightness and justice. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+41:10&version=AMP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 41:10</a>)

5 Let your character or moral disposition be free from love of money [including greed, avarice, lust, and craving for earthly possessions] and be satisfied with your present [circumstances and with what you have]; for He [God] Himself has said, I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor leave you without support. [I will] not, [I will] not, [I will] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor let [you] down (relax My hold on you)! [Assuredly not!] 6 So we take comfort and are encouraged and confidently and boldly say, The Lord is my Helper; I will not be seized with alarm [I will not fear or dread or be terrified]. What can man do to me? (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13:5-6&version=AMP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 13:5-6</a>)

</div>

### COMFORT IN TIME OF SORROW

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

3 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, 4 who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God. 5 For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+1:3-5&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Cor. 1:3-5</a>)

</div>

### RELIEF IN TIME OF SUFFERING

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

8 Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. 9 But He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. 10 That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+12:8-10&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Cor. 12:8-10</a>)

3 Consider Him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. 4 In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 5 And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons: "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you, 6 because the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son." 7 Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father? 8 If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons. 9 Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live! 10 Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness. 11 No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it. 12 Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. 13 "Make level paths for your feet," so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12:3-13&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 12:3-13</a>)

</div>

### GUIDANCE IN TIME OF DECISION

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

5 If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. 6 But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1:5-6&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:5-6</a>)

5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; 6 in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+3:5-6&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>)

</div>

### PROTECTION IN TIME OF DANGER

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

1 He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. 2 I will say of the LORD, "He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust." 3 Surely he will save you from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence. 4 He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. 5 You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, 6 nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday. 7 A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. 8 You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked. 9 If you make the Most High your dwelling— even the LORD, who is my refuge- 10 then no harm will befall you, no disaster will come near your tent. 11 For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; 12 they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. 13 You will tread upon the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent. 14 "Because he loves me," says the LORD, "I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name. 15 He will call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him. 16 With long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation." (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+91&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 91</a>)

1 I lift up my eyes to the hills—where does my help come from? 2 My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. 3 He will not let your foot slip— he who watches over you will not slumber; 4 indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 5 The LORD watches over you— the LORD is your shade at your right hand; 6 the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. 7 The LORD will keep you from all harm— he will watch over your life; 8 the LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+121&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 121</a>)

</div>

### COURAGE IN TIME OF FEAR

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

5 Let your character or moral disposition be free from love of money [including greed, avarice, lust, and craving for earthly possessions] and be satisfied with your present [circumstances and with what you have]; for He [God] Himself has said, I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor leave you without support. [I will] not, [I will] not, [I will] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor let [you] down (relax My hold on you)! [Assuredly not!] 6 So we take comfort and are encouraged and confidently and boldly say, The Lord is my Helper; I will not be seized with alarm [I will not fear or dread or be terrified]. What can man do to me? (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13:5-6&version=AMP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 13:5-6</a>)

10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11 Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6:10-18&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>)

</div>

### PEACE IN TIME OF TURMOIL

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

3 You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in you. 4 Trust in the LORD forever, for the LORD, the LORD, is the Rock eternal. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+26:3-4&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 26:3-4</a>)

6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4:6-7&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phil. 4:6-7</a>)

</div>

### REST IN TIME OF WEARINESS

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

28 "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light." (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11:28-30&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt. 11:28-30</a>)

1 THE LORD is my Shepherd [to feed, guide, and shield me], I shall not lack. 2 He makes me lie down in [fresh, tender] green pastures; He leads me beside the still and restful waters. 3 He refreshes and restores my life (my self); He leads me in the paths of righteousness [uprightness and right standing with Him–not for my earning it, but] for His name's sake. 4 Yes, though I walk through the [deep, sunless] valley of the shadow of death, I will fear or dread no evil, for You are with me; Your rod [to protect] and Your staff [to guide], they comfort me. 5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my [brimming] cup runs over. 6 Surely or only goodness, mercy, and unfailing love shall follow me all the days of my life, and through the length of my days the house of the Lord [and His presence] shall be my dwelling place. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+23&version=AMP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 23</a>)

</div>

### STRENGTH IN TIME OF TEMPTATION

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

12 Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. 13 When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; 14 but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. 15 Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. 16 Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1:12-16&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:12-16</a>)

6 Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did. 7 Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: "The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan revelry." 8 We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did—and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died. 9 We should not test the Lord, as some of them did—and were killed by snakes. 10 And do not grumble, as some of them did—and were killed by the destroying angel. 11 These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come. 12 So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall! 13 No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+10:6-13&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Cor. 10:6-13</a>)

</div>

### FORGIVENESS IN TIME OF CONVICTION

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #3498db; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">

18 "Come now, let us reason together," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+1:18&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 1:18</a>)

7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin. 8 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1:7-9&version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 1:7-9</a>)
