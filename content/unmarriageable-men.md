UNMARRIAGEABLE MEN
### by Sylvester Onyemalechi

Just as there are unmarriageable women, so also there are unmarriageable men. The purpose of this study is to expose those people that will give problems in marriage if married because of their bad character and habits.

If you are a man, all I want you to do is to identify those things that disqualify you for marriage and eliminate them from your life, thereby, making yourself qualify. If you are a woman, you look for the man that qualifies and not the man who does not qualify. If you marry any of those who are categorized as unmarriageable, you will have your hands full of problems. The purpose of my teaching on this is to help the unmarried enter into relationships that will succeed, full of fun and laughter and last a life time.

### **1. A FOOLISH MAN**

*Through wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; 4 By knowledge the rooms are filled With all precious and pleasant riches. 5 A wise man is strong, yes, a man of knowledge increases strength; (Prov 24:3-5) NKJV*

Marriage is likened to a building that is supposed to have good, strong and durable foundation. The bible teaches in the passage above that it takes wisdom to build a house. It takes wisdom to relate with somebody successfully without fights for a life time. It takes wisdom to relate with someone who grew up in a different environment than yours. It takes wisdom to live happily with someone whose upbringing and training is different from yours. It takes wisdom to forbear and forgive when offended. The Bible teaches that wisdom is the principal thing in life. By wisdom God created all things, and by wisdom He sustains all that He created. Every relationship thrives on wisdom. Wisdom is the right application of the knowledge received. Some have relevant knowledge but never use them. Therefore we call them fools. So we have a lot of educated fools in our society today. To know the temperament of your friend is not enough, you must make use of that knowledge to make your relationship with that person free of quarrels and crisis.

All ladies need to look out for a wise man as a husband. How do you identify him? 

- As you relate, you watch for how the man works with the information you give to him about yourself with the intent to make your relationship crisis free.  
- How he relates with you based on knowledge supplied by you will tell you if he is wise or not.  
- A wise man is careful in his actions and words.  
- He chooses his words carefully before speaking and is careful not to say what will spark a quarrel.  
- He is careful in giving advice and handling sensitive matters.  
- A wise man recognizes his leadership role in the family and will do everything within his power to make sure the home is safe and peaceful.  
- He knows he will not blame anyone for the failure of his marriage, not even his wife. As a result, he is careful.


### **2. A LAZY MAN**

*33 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest; 34 So shall your poverty come like a prowler, And your need like an armed man. Prov 24:33-34 NKJV*

*19 He who works his land will have abundant food, but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty. Prov 28:19 NIV*

Every husband should be a hard worker. A lazy man will only punish his family because he cannot provide for them. It is therefore necessary that a woman marry a working man. When God created man, he "put him in the garden of Eden to work it and take care of it"(Gen. 2:15). God never planned that man will be lazy. He made man to work and earn his living and that of his family. To be lazy therefore is not good, and does not get the backing of God. When you want to get married to a man, first be sure his income is enough to take care of the house. Be sure he has a source of income in the first place. Non-working men are not qualified to marry at all. If you are not working you shouldn't be talking about marriage because you are not qualified. That you need a man who can take care of you does not mean that you need a millionaire. You just need a working man whose income is enough to run the house.

### **3. AN IMMORAL MAN**

*20 My son, keep your father's commands and do not forsake your mother's teaching. Prov 6:20 NIV*

*24 keeping you from the immoral woman, from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife. 25 Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes, 26 for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the adulteress preys upon your very life. 27 Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned? 28 Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched? 29 So is he who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished. Prov 6:24-29 NIV*

*18 Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. 1 Cor 6:18 NIV*

A wayward man is a painful burden. Getting married to a man that has not proven to you that he will be faithful to you is an invitation to a painful life. Nobody wants to share her lover with another. No matter how much in a hurry you are in getting married, it is obvious that you will not share your partner with another. It is therefore very important that you find out more about the life of the man you want to marry as far as this issue is concerned. You can't stand the torture and shame that is associated with this kind of behavior. Let him change before you marry him. Don't say to yourself, he will change. Be sure of the change before you say, 'yes I do'. A man, who is courting more than one person at a time, will probably be unfaithful in future. Keep your eyes open to know if the one you are in relationship with is interested in another person or persons apart from you.

### **4. AN UNFORGIVING MAN**

*30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 31 Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. 32 Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you. Eph 4:30-32 NIV*

*Love...5 It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 1 Cor 13:5 NIV*

*12 Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.' 14 For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins. Matt 6:12-15 NIV*

Forgiveness is very vital to the survival of any relationship. It is important therefore that intending couples make effort to build themselves up in this area. Building yourself up is practicing forgiveness at all times. An unforgiving man is a difficult person to live with. An unforgiving person will always be a bitter man and an unhappy man who never offloads evil experiences from his mind. Living with such a person will be horrible. Identifying such a man is not difficult. Just study your man while relating with him. There are those who forgive easily, and there are those who you will have to beg and beg before they consider forgiving you. Mark such a person. There are those who don't talk too much, but withdraw from the offender and avoids every contact with such a person. In most cases, they don't even tell their offender what they have done. Your daily experience with the man will let you know if he is unforgiving or not, and if he is making effort to change or not. Be careful! Marriage is for sweetness and not for bitterness. You need a happy man and not a bitter man. You need a man who oozes out love and happiness, whose countenance inspires and not the opposite.

### **5. A GOLD DIGGER**

*17 Food gained by fraud tastes sweet to a man, but he ends up with a mouth full of gravel. Prov 20:17 NIV*

*6 A fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare. Prov 21:6 NIV*

A gold digger is one who is looking for a lady who has money. A gold digger searches for girls who are from wealthy homes, successful and have good paying jobs for the purpose of reaping where they have not sown. They don't have real love in their heart for the lady, but the money she has. Unfortunately, most ladies cannot easily identify a gold digger simply because they are too emotional to see what they ought to see. And sometimes, they are so pressed to get married, that they fall prey to such men. Look before you leap. Check him out before you get too close. Weigh every word spoken and ask relevant questions that will get the cat out of the bag. Be sure there is genuine love. **Lift the mask and see who is behind the mask and save yourself from regrets and pain.** Prayerfully determine who he is and what he is after. Only God can help you in this matter. **That is why you must pray that God unmask everyone that seeks a relationship with you so you will know who they really are.** If you pray earnestly with your whole heart, God will reveal all you need to you. Suddenly, all the person has been hiding will start showing up in his speech, actions, from his friends, and some times through supernatural revelations.

### **6. A MAN WITHOUT VISION**

*18 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. Prov 29:18 KJV*

Vision brings focus to a man's life. Where there is no vision the people suffer and cast off restraint. A man without vision has no focus in life. He has nothing driving him on in life. It is important that you marry a man with vision, because a man with vision has direction in his life – he knows where he is going. To marry a man who does not know where he is going or is going nowhere, is suicide. 

Life is more than 'I love you'. **The experiences of life affect love.** It can make it grow, and it can make it die. It is therefore important that people planning to get married should look at the future before making a final decision for or against marrying a particular person. Ask the man first, what is your vision in life?' Your vision must not be contrary to that of your intended spouse. If you are going to the North Pole and your intended partner is going to the South Pole, you will be sure that there will be problem in that marriage because of the conflict of vision. Make sure you agree on vision before a final decision is made.

### **7. AN UNBELIEVER**

*14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? 15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? 16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, 18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. 2 Cor 6:14-18 KJV*

An unbeliever has nothing in common with a believer as far as spiritual relationships are concerned. In marriage, the souls of the two people involved are tied together through the sexual communion. To join the temple of God with the temple of the devil or Belial, is calling for war. God himself says it won't work. The believer is called the light, while the unbeliever is called darkness. The believer is called righteousness, while the unbeliever is called wickedness. The believer is called the temple of God, while the unbeliever is called the temple of Belial (Devil). God says the unbeliever is unclean; therefore the believer should come out of them. How can a believer then marry an unbeliever?

The conclusion of the matter is that if you the believer will stay away from joining yourself to an unbeliever in marriage and their lifestyle, God says, he will take you as his son or daughter and he will be your Father. Don't make the mistake of going contrary to this instruction. You can never be wiser than God.

### **8. AN UNCARING MAN**

*25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. Eph 5:25-27 KJV*

Husbands are commanded and expected to love their wives with all their heart. That is to say they are supposed to be caring and affectionate towards their wives. It is therefore wise for a lady to look out for a caring man who will make a good husband. **Unfortunately, ladies mistake buying gifts to mean caring.** I do agree that if you care for someone you will buy the person gifts, but you must also understand that someone can buy you a gift without caring for you. Caring goes beyond gifts. How much time is the person willing to give to you? In the case of illness and unpleasant experiences, will he be willing to share his time with you and be there when you need him? There are many questions you need to ask to find out how much love he has for you. Look out for a caring man. As you relate, keep your eyes open.

### **CONCLUSION**

Look out for the man that is marriageable. Don't be too much in a hurry, and blindly marry someone who will not be compatible to your kind of person. Do not be too emotional and close your eyes to the things you are supposed to take a close look at. Be very careful in making a choice. Don't think of divorce in future. Rather think of making the right choice now. May God help you make the right choice in Jesus name.
